  <h1>Leap Year Warmup Exercise</h1>
  <h3>Do this in HTML and JS!</h3>

  <p>Write a function that will take any given year and return whether it is a leap year or not.</p>
  <p>Remember that a leap year is:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Every year that is evenly divisible by 4</li>
    <li>Except if it is evenly divisible by 100...</li>
    <li>Unless it is also divisible by 400</li>

  </ul>
  <h3>Test Data... Make sure it is working!</h3>
  <p>1997 is not a leap year, it should return false</p>
  <p>1996 is a leap year, it should return true</p>
  <p>1900 is not a leap year, it should return false</p>
  <p>2000 is a leap year, it should return true</p>
  <p>How to structure it...</p>

  <p><strong>We want a custom function called isLeapYear</strong></p>
  <br/>
  <h3>Bonus!</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Ask the user what number they want to test</li>
  </ul>
