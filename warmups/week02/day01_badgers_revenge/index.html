  <h1>Badger's Revenge</h1>
  <br>
  <p>The names of those who are witnessed clapping Badger more than twice in the first four days of any one week will go into a draw. On Friday morning, a random name will be drawn from that list and the 'winner' will be forced to deliver the solution to Friday's warmup.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Create a program that Badger can use for this task - ideally, you should create an object (revengeOfBadger) to do this, but if you can get it working using standalone functions, that's cool.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Your program should:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Track how many times each student in the class has clapped this week (just make up the numbers);</li>
    <li>Include a collection of candidates for the Friday draw (ie, a list of names of people who have clapped Badger more than twice that week);</li>
    <li>Pick a random student to deliver the solution to Friday's warmup.</li>
    <li>If no one has clapped enough that week, the program should indicate that Badger has to do his own damned warmup.</li>
  </ul>
